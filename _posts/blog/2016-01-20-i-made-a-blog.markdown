Hello there!
So I decided to start a blog! I have been thinking about this for a while now, as I have worked on quite a few cool projects over the years, but not bothered documenting them much. So for my own sake, and hopefully someone else out there I will start documenting some of my builds.

I am definitely not the best writer, so there will likely be quite a few spelling errors and bad sentences in this blog. However, it is my firm belief that it is better than not writing anything at all. The spell checking and multiple read-through will be reserved to my academic career.

So why now? Well, I am working on a quite cool project at the moment. I am building a full scale BB-8 unit from the new Star Wars movie, and people have been asking about my progress from all over the world. So I am officially #notbuildingbb8 now! Why am I building a BB-8? I have always wanted to build my own R2-D2 unit, but once I saw the BB-8 I just had to build that instead. I am finishing up my Master in Science degree in Engineering Cybernetics this year, and for us that enjoy working with control theory, nothing is more fun than balancing stuff on top of each other, as well as weird drive systems that are vastly impractical. So BB-8 it is!

I have done some work on it already, mostly in CAD. I have attached some pictures of the current progress, which will be the main topics for later blog posts!
